# Go by Example: Range over Built-in Types

_range_ iterates over elements in a variety of built-in data structures. Let’s see how to use `range` with some of the data structures we’ve already learned.

Here we use `range` to sum the numbers in a slice. Arrays work like this too. `range` on arrays and slices provides both the index and value for each entry. Above we didn’t need the index, so we ignored it with the blank identifier `_`. Sometimes we actually want the indexes though. `range` on map iterates over key/value pairs.

`range` can also iterate over just the keys of a map. `range` on strings iterates over Unicode code points. The first value is the starting byte index of the `rune` and the second the `rune` itself.
 
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {

    nums := []int{2, 3, 4}
    sum := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        sum += num
    }
    fmt.Println("sum:", sum)

    for i, num := range nums {
        if num == 3 {
            fmt.Println("index:", i)
        }
    }

    kvs := map[string]string{"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}
    for k, v := range kvs {
        fmt.Printf("%s -> %s\n", k, v)
    }

    for k := range kvs {
        fmt.Println("key:", k)
    }

    for i, c := range "go" {
        fmt.Println(i, c)
    }
}
```

Output:

```Bash
$ go run range-over-built-in-types.go
sum: 9
index: 1
a -> apple
b -> banana
key: a
key: b
0 103
1 111
```
