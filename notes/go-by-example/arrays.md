# Go by Example: Arrays

In Go, an array is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length. In typical Go code, slices are much more common; arrays are useful in some special scenarios.

Here we create an array a that will hold exactly 5 ints. The type of elements and length are both part of the arrayâ€™s type. By default an array is zero-valued, which for ints means 0s.

We can set a value at an index using the `array[index] = value` syntax, and get a value with `array[index]`. The builtin `len` returns the length of an array. Use this syntax to declare and initialize an array in one line. You can also have the compiler count the number of elements for you with `...`

If you specify the index with `:`, the elements in between will be zeroed. Array types are one-dimensional, but you can compose types to build multi-dimensional data structures. You can create and initialize multi-dimensional arrays at once too. Note that arrays appear in the form `[v1 v2 v3 ...]` when printed with `fmt.Println`.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    var a [5]int
    fmt.Println("emp:", a)

    a[4] = 100
    fmt.Println("set:", a)
    fmt.Println("get:", a[4])

    fmt.Println("len:", len(a))

    b := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println("dcl:", b)

    b = [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println("dcl:", b)

    b = [...]int{100, 3: 400, 500}
    fmt.Println("idx:", b)

    var twoD [2][3]int
    for i := range 2 {
        for j := range 3 {
            twoD[i][j] = i + j
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("2d: ", twoD)

    twoD = [2][3]int{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {1, 2, 3},
    }
    fmt.Println("2d: ", twoD)
}
```

Output:

```Bash
$ go run arrays.go
emp: [0 0 0 0 0]
set: [0 0 0 0 100]
get: 100
len: 5
dcl: [1 2 3 4 5]
dcl: [1 2 3 4 5]
idx: [100 0 0 400 500]
2d:  [[0 1 2] [1 2 3]]
2d:  [[1 2 3] [1 2 3]]
