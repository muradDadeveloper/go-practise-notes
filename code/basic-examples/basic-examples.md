# 📘 Basic Go Examples

This section contains a collection of **basic Go code examples** that I’ve studied and implemented while learning the language.  
The goal of this folder is to document my **hands-on practice** and provide a quick reference for myself (and others) as I progress from beginner to more advanced topics.
